# Student-Performance-Analysis-Project

This project explores the Student Performance Dataset, which contains information about students' scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and socio-economic factors such as:
- Gender
- Race/ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
- Test preparation course (completed or none)

Steps Taken
1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Loaded the dataset and previewed the first few records.
- Checked for missing values and verified data types.

2. Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical columns to category data type for efficient processing.

3. Data Visualization
- Histograms: Visualized distributions of math, reading, and writing scores.
- Bar Plots by Gender: Compared mean scores between male and female students.
- Bar Plots by Race/Ethnicity: Analyzed score differences across ethnic groups.
